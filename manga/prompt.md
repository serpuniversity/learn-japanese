# OVERVIEW

You will be provided a screenshot from a manga. It may be written in hiragana, katakana, kanji, or a combination. Your task is to perform a series of translation steps to help an English speaker (a beginner learning Japanese) have an easier time reading, learning & understanding Japanese through mangas.


## INSTRUCTIONS

For the provided screenshot, perform each of the following tasks for each of the manga panels:

1. ORIGINAL: Write the original message from the screenshot
2. KANA/FURIGANA/ROMAJI: Write the kana version (aka, convert the kanji into hiragana for readability)
3. TRANSLATION: In a table, translate each word one-by-one. Including the original word in japanese, the literal translation, and then the translation based on all the known context for what it probably is saying in "natural english".
*. EDITORIAL: Add in any helpful editorialization about the scene that helps the reader understand it, or learn something more about Japanese language/culture/etc.

### *. EDITORIAL

In this scene, Goku is startled as a strange yokai appears from inside a monster. The word “yokai” (妖怪) refers to supernatural creatures in Japanese folklore, which can range from mischievous spirits to terrifying demons.

The phrase 「へんな妖怪がでた！」 captures his surprise, with へんな (henna) meaning “weird” or “strange” and でた (deta) meaning “came out” or “appeared.” This is a very typical way of expressing sudden appearances in Japanese manga and anime.

If you’re learning Japanese, this scene is great for understanding how のなかから (no naka kara, “from inside”) works to describe things emerging from within something else.
